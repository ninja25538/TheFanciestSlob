Why is it that every time I click on a link it puts an ad first?: <br>
I don't like to put ads on a page because A. this site already looks novice made and B. it will look disgusting so instead
I put all my when you click on a link with LinkShrink so that I might be able to buy a better computer, do this full time, get an
actual domain, etc.
