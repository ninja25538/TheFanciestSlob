      (Insert funny introduction) it's a me, dat boi. So anyways today since I'm hip and trendy I'm gonna be talking about
      the news. I'll try not to depress you since no joke I see nothng happy on the news ever. Also this isn't my source, but
      it makes watching the news funny and enjoyable. It's called <a href="http://linkshrink.net/7o5RUh">Some News.</a>
      Trust me it's pretty funny and I enjoy it. 
    </p> 
    <p>
      First up on, TFS News, Hurricane Irma, the old ladiest sounding hurricane, is heading over to Florida for a nice vacation, but
      it will find it empty since there's a huge evacuation. It's starting to become a massive storm, a catagory 5 hurricane, which
      sounds like my sister after I want to use the TV. Speaking of kids being stupid, a couple teens started a gorge fire by
      throwing fireworks into said gorge. Come on you guys, I mean, you should know better, we're not stupid. Come on now.
      Speaking of now, <b>DESTINY 2 CAME OUT!!!!</b> I don't about you but I was seriously excited about it. I've heard some
      pretty good reviews about it but I still haven't played it =(. Hope yall enjoyed this and please check out my blog everyday!
      One more piece of news, I've added ads to my site! I know you guys are probably not excited about it but I'm only putting
      one per page, I'm not a monster. I also am going to keep the linkshrink thing since the ads pay very little and only if
      you click on it. Hope you guys aren't too mad about it =)
