      Evenin' ladies and gents. Now I'm going to tell you an interesting thing. I hacked my sister's 9 digit chromebook password
      without using any computers. You're probably thinking <i>he's lying, what a liar. I hate liars.</i> But no. I used a lovely
      tool called Social Engineering (tricking someone into giving you sensitive information). So my sister bet that I couldn't
      crack my sister's chromebook password first try. I said bring it on. So after a few days when she forgot, I asked her what the
      6th digit was. She told me 2. Now the reason this was such a massive help is that these Chromebooks are school owned, so that
      since they don't feel like generatoing good passwords, they just put in there student id numbers. Now I know that it's Their 
      grad year, plus 3 zeros, plus 3 digits. I know her grad year and the 3 zeros, so then there were only 100 passwords to guess. I
      used bruteforce and guessed (sistersgradyear)000201, (sistersgradyear)000202... and kept going until I got the password! Use Social
      Engineering, it makes it so much easier to get information. Instead of what I did, I could have guessed 999 passwords, but
      I guessed 100 instead! Social Engineering (it's a life saver trust me).
