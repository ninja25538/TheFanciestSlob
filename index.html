    <p>Heya guys it's me again! You guys probably didn't
    expect me to post today since I didn't post this weekend
    but I amm so ha! So anyways since I'm hip and trendy and
    cool I'm going to talk about the solar eclipse. So you've
    probably heard all the boring safety stuff and someone
    telling you "Joseph don't look at the eclipse without
    your goggles", and "JOE DON'T LOOK AT THE ECLIPSE!!!".
    So...I won't talk about that. But anyways the eclipse
    is coming up and if you live where there will be a total
    or almost total eclipse you should be ready. Sadly though,
    the glasses have just about sold out (at least in my area)
    so you might want some alternatives, you might know some
    of these, you might not. But either way you'll probably
    want to read this because I'm such a cool person and I want
    to ride this clickbait wave before it crashes.

    Now first of all what is da eclipse. Without getting too
    sciency an eclipse is when da moon blocks da sun. It gets
    really cold and really dark for a few minutes and then it's
    normal for over a year. If you couldn't understand this my
    4 year old sister could so go back to preschool). Some
    people are saying things like "ZEE WORLD IS GOING TO END
    TODAY!!!", which is just stupid ok. I bet all the bitcoin
    I have that the world will <b>not</b> end. If it doesn't
    end you have to give be $1 in bitcoin (donation button 
    at the bottom of the page). I mean it could happen now that
    I think about it, like North Korea could do something or
    Russia and/or China (The West Koreas) could do something.
    You know what, now that I think about it, the world is too
    negative. I mean, 
      <a href="http://linkshrink.net/7VKrh6">We Become What We Behold</a> Covers it perfectly (that game scares me to this day).
    So anyway, I love you all and don't die!
