      It's Friday My Dudes. Now today I'm here to talk about what all of you wish you had. A Ferrari- er I mean money.
      Now I have made a carefully rendered graph about the statistics of money
      <img src="Moolah Graph.png" alt="Super Cool Money Graph You Can't See" height="50" width="50">
    </p>
    <p>So as you can tell, money makes you richer. Mind blowing I know. But this is something even more insane, people 
    will give you money if you work for them (cue explosin in mind). I know this sounds insane but I have checked with my agents,
    all of this is true. However, the goverment made a rule where you have to be a certain age to work. I unfortuanetly, fall under
    that age in my area. Now for all of you that fall under that age to or maybe just feel like getting some more green paper that's
    worthless but humans value it for some reason, here's a few ways to get money over the internet.
    </p>
    <p>
    1. Bitcoin mining and faucets: I'm not going to go over what this is because I'm really tired and it's complicated but go
    <a href="http://linkshrink.net/7V4KFF"> here</a> to find out smore more information. After you learn about this and you do feel
    like mining, I would strongly reccommend using<a href="http://linkshrink.net/7aQshh"> MinerGate </a> as your miner just because
    I know that they pay out and pay decently. (They have an android app, windows miner, and cloud mining. After you've made a bit
    and feel like giving to the person that got you into mining, donate some bitcoin to this address:174sbKTfEdt9REefVbHWea678ggwd8MVy8

    2. Microsoft Rewards:
    I have some good news and bad news about this one. The good news in it gives you Windows and Xbox gift cards for browsing the
    web, searching, and doing fun quizzes. The bad news in you have to ...use...Bing (throws up on keyboard). I know what your
    thinking and I was wary too. If I'm going to be honest, I've been using it for a month now and it isn't that bad. I would switch
    back to Google immediately (but they haven't to my knowledge). It also doesn't pay a lot but it's decent. If you make 500 points
    a month you get special discounts on stuff. You can use the points you get for gift cards, raffles, and anything on Windows.
    (I bought a couple of gift cards and I'm saving up for a headset) <a href="http://linkshrink.net/7ytRcs">link to Microsoft
      Rewards</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
    3. Grabpoints
    This one is super slow but you can get some decent rewards from it. It's called Grabpoints. It pays you for downloading apps and
      completing surveys. <a href="http://linkshrink.net/7ThWp0">Here's da link</a>. Use refferal code RLHYOW.
