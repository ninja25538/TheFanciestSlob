     Heya peoples it's still me, that one random internet troll that also tells stories and makes jokes. So I was 
      going to post this yesterday but I got <b>really</b> annoyed because I had this entire post written yesterday 
      but then my laptop died. So then I rewrote it AGAIN and some idiot turned my laptop off. So yeah. Anyways so
      our school is a very boring place but the things that happen in it are fantastic stories. One great example of
      this is that just now, we had to bring our backpacks out into the hallway to get sniffed for drugs. No I don't
      think that any of us have them but they did the same thing yesterday and I heard some dogs bark so...
    </p> 
    <p>
    Speaking of people on drugs those dudes that thought the world was going to end now owe me a dollar
      in Bitcoin because (shockingly) the world didn't end as far as I know. Another interesting thing that happened at
      at my school. So one day some idiot decided to threaten my school via Twitter with bomb threats unless they did what
      he said. I know it's reaaaaaally stupid. That's like if I went on Facebook and said heehee going to burn the 
      White House today #2cool4prison. So since the guy was some random troll (that didn't tell stories or make jokes)
      that also went TO THE SCHOOL, he got arrested. I'm not sure where he is now but probably in jail.
      So anyways hope yall saw this post and donate some Bitcoin since I'm a good person!
    </p>
