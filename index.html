    Latest Post: <br>
      Sah my dudes and welcome to my first post. I'm actually writing this as I'm building this site so it probably looks pretty weird.
      So anyway I wasn't even done building this page when I got a story to tell. So I was at lunch at my school and I forgot my lunchbox
      in the lunchroom (because I was thinking about how I was going to build this site). I went to my homeroom class and I started working
      On my homework when some kid said that the vice principal was calling me. Poor innocent little me went out of the classroom and
      the she and some teacher was there. So she had my lunch box and asked "Is this yours". I trying to look innocent went YAAAAAS. And
      she had a photo of my lunchbox in the middle of the table I'd beein sitting at and said, "You need to clean up after yourself". So
      I said sorry and I grabbed my lunch box and started to walk away. Then she said "You have a lunch detention for leaving your
      lunch box". Me being the chill bro that I was said "Cool cool" and walked away. I'm not even mad that I got a lunch detention though
      I'm just mad that she gave it to me for no reason. I mead I would get it if I threw food or something but still, it's stupid. Shoot
      me <a href="http://linkshrink.net/7YeNFl">an email</a> or donate a few bitcoin! I'd love to hear from you guys!
