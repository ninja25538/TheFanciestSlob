Sah my dudes and welcome to my first post. I'm actually writing this as I'm building this site so it probably looks pretty weird.
      So anyway I wasn't even done building this page when I got a story to tell. So I was at lunch at my school and I forgot my lunchbox
      in the lunchroom (because I was thinking about how I was going to build this site). I went to my homeroom class and I started working
      On my homework when some kid said that the vice principal was calling me. Poor innocent little me went out of the classroom and
      the she and some teacher was there. So she had my lunch box and asked "Is this yours". I trying to look innocent went YAAAAAS. And
      she had a photo of my lunchbox in the middle of the table I'd beein sitting at and said, "You need to clean up after yourself". So
      I said sorry and I grabbed my lunch box and started to walk away. Then she said "You have a lunch detention for leaving your
      lunch box". Me being the chill bro that I was said "Cool cool" and walked away. I'm not even mad that I got a lunch detention though
      I'm just mad that she gave it to me for no reason. I mead I would get it if I threw food or something but still, it's stupid. Shoot
      me <a href="http://linkshrink.net/7YeNFl">an email</a> or donate a few bitcoin! I'd love to hear from you guys!

      It's Friday My Dudes. Now today I'm here to talk about what all of you wish you had. A Ferrari- er I mean money.
      Now I have made a carefully rendered graph about the statistics of money
      <img src="Moolah Graph.png" alt="Super Cool Money Graph You Can't See" height="200" width="250">
    </p>
    <p>So as you can tell, money makes you richer. Mind blowing I know. But this is something even more insane, people 
    will give you money if you work for them (cue explosin in mind). I know this sounds insane but I have checked with my agents,
    all of this is true. However, the goverment made a rule where you have to be a certain age to work. I unfortuanetly, fall under
    that age in my area. Now for all of you that fall under that age to or maybe just feel like getting some more green paper that's
    worthless but humans value it for some reason, here's a few ways to get money over the internet.
    </p>
    <p>
    1. Bitcoin mining and faucets: I'm not going to go over what this is because I'm really tired and it's complicated but go
    <a href="http://linkshrink.net/7V4KFF"> here</a> to find out smore more information. After you learn about this and you do feel
    like mining, I would strongly reccommend using<a href="http://linkshrink.net/7aQshh"> MinerGate </a> as your miner just because
    I know that they pay out and pay decently. (They have an android app, windows miner, and cloud mining. After you've made a bit
    and feel like giving to the person that got you into mining, donate some bitcoin to this address:174sbKTfEdt9REefVbHWea678ggwd8MVy8
      <br>
    </p>  
    <p>
    2. Microsoft Rewards:
    I have some good news and bad news about this one. The good news in it gives you Windows and Xbox gift cards for browsing the
    web, searching, and doing fun quizzes. The bad news in you have to ...use...Bing (throws up on keyboard). I know what your
    thinking and I was wary too. If I'm going to be honest, I've been using it for a month now and it isn't that bad. I would switch
    back to Google immediately (but they haven't to my knowledge). It also doesn't pay a lot but it's decent. If you make 500 points
    a month you get special discounts on stuff. You can use the points you get for gift cards, raffles, and anything on Windows.
    (I bought a couple of gift cards and I'm saving up for a headset) <a href="http://linkshrink.net/7ytRcs">link to Microsoft
      Rewards</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
    3. Grabpoints
    This one is super slow but you can get some decent rewards from it. It's called Grabpoints. It pays you for downloading apps and
      completing surveys. <a href="http://linkshrink.net/7ThWp0">Here's da link</a>. Use refferal code RLHYOW.
    </p>
    
    <p>So in total, have fun, use these sites, and subscribe for more updates</p>

    <p>Heya guys it's me again! You guys probably didn't
    expect me to post today since I didn't post this weekend
    but I amm so ha! So anyways since I'm hip and trendy and
    cool I'm going to talk about the solar eclipse. So you've
    probably heard all the boring safety stuff and someone
    telling you "Joseph don't look at the eclipse without
    your goggles", and "JOE DON'T LOOK AT THE ECLIPSE!!!".
    So...I won't talk about that. But anyways the eclipse
    is coming up and if you live where there will be a total
    or almost total eclipse you should be ready. Sadly though,
    the glasses have just about sold out (at least in my area)
    so you might want some alternatives, you might know some
    of these, you might not. But either way you'll probably
    want to read this because I'm such a cool person and I want
    to ride this clickbait wave before it crashes. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Now first of all what is da eclipse. Without getting too
    sciency an eclipse is when da moon blocks da sun. It gets
    really cold and really dark for a few minutes and then it's
    normal for over a year. If you couldn't understand this my
    4 year old sister could so go back to preschool). Some
    people are saying things like "ZEE WORLD IS GOING TO END
    TODAY!!!", which is just stupid ok. I bet all the bitcoin
    I have that the world will <b>not</b> end. If it doesn't
    end you have to give be $1 in bitcoin (donation button 
    at the bottom of the page). I mean it could happen now that
    I think about it, like North Korea could do something or
    Russia and/or China (The West Koreas) could do something.
    You know what, now that I think about it, the world is too
    negative. I mean, 
      <a href="http://linkshrink.net/7VKrh6">We Become What We Behold</a> Covers it perfectly (that game scares me to this day).
    So anyway, I love you all and don't die!
    </p>
